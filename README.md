# Basic-authentication
I have made a authentication app in node.js it keeping it very simple and deployed it using Heroku and mongolab.The idea of the app is to hide a page(here referred as secret) from the users that have not logged in. The same format can be extended to many other applications.I have used passport for authentication. The key goal here is to understand the process of deploying the app. 
Here's the link of working deployed version : https://afternoon-mountain-85708.herokuapp.com/
